On Segregation the skeleton of the APP.

One way to break down the components is to also create a Table Component and further break down into table row, table data etc. 
That would mean we are trying to create a design system. Since we are not that big yet, it doesn't make sense to do that.
For now I have broken it down only in one file.

Rest, I have commented on the places, where I saw many ways of doing it.

Structure:
Components - There's no business logic inside this
Containers - This holds all the business logic
